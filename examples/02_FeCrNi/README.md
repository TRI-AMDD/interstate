# Crystalization of FeCrNi 

Application of **InterState** to atomistic simulations of FeCrNi. 

## Results 
1. Removing pooling layers shows that we learn something related to the degree of crystalinity (is my local envrioenemnt solid or liquid)
## Limitations 
1. Recall: I think because of sigmoid activations, the network doesn't train for the first few epoch, but then eventually the loss decreases very fast
